Build scripts can echo build settings to Dub

Scripts run with `preBuildCommands` can echo lines to provide dynamic build
settings to Dub. E.g. a script can echo the following lines:
---
dub:json:{ "lflags": "-L/some/probed/path" }
dub:sdl:importPaths "/path/to/generated/package"
---
A good use of this is to probe for an existing library on the system,
to build it if not found, and to provide the relevant link flags to Dub.
